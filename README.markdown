# SoundCleod OBS Edition

This is a fork of [SoundCleod](https://soundcleod.com) originally created by Márton Salomváry. The only purpose of this fork is to integrate with [OBS (Open Broadcaster Software)](https://obsproject.com/).

**If you have problems with the OBS integration, please contact [ErraticFox](https://github.com/ErraticFox), the creator and maintainer of this fork.**

If you do not use the OBS integration it is strongly recommended to use the latest [SoundCleod](https://soundcleod.com) from the original source.
